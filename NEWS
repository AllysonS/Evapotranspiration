		CHANGES IN Evapotranspiration VERSION 1.4

NEW FEATURES
    o  In function ReadInputs: Adding checks to ensure processed daily values are physically meaningful (i.e. uz/u2 > 0; Rs > 0; 0 < n < 24; P > 0; Epan > 0; RHmax/RHmin > 0)  

    o  In function ETComparison: Enabling user-defined label text for the comparison plots

    o  In function ETComparison: Enabling user-defined starting and finishing data for comparison plots with types of 'Daily', 'Monthly' and 'Annual' 

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o  The output variable names 'PET.Daily', 'PET.Monthly', 'PET.Annual', 'PET.MonthlyAve' and 'PET.AnnualAve' from ET formulations has been replaced with 'ET.Daily', 'ET.Monthly', 'ET.Annual', 'ET.MonthlyAve' and 'ET.AnnualAve' respectively to avoid confusion

    o  The output variable names 'PET_formulation' and 'PET_type' from ET formulations has been replaced with 'ET_formulation' and 'ET_type' respectively to avoid confusion
    
    o  Argument 'labs' in ETComparison can be used to define text for lables in comparison plots - see manual for details

    o  Arguments 'Sdate' and 'Edate' in ETComparison can be used to define starting and finishing data for comparison plots with types of 'Daily', 'Monthly' and 'Annual' - see manual for details

    o  Arguments 'ymin' and 'ymax' in ETComparison have been replaced with a single arguement 'ylim' with length of 2 - see manual for details

BUG FIXES
    o  Fixed bugs in the use of argument 'stopmissing' in function ReadInput for checking maximum duration of missing data
    
    o  Fixed bugs in the Matt-Shuttleworth formulation

    o  Fixed bugs in the use of argument 'solar' in the Morton formulations to be enable using the data of sunshine hours

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

   o	The value of the argument 'solar' has been updated to be consistent with other formulations - a value of 'sunshine hours' should be used to implement calculations from the data of sunshine hours
